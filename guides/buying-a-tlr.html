    <h1>How to Buy a Used TLR Camera</h1>
    <p class="updated">The complete inspection checklist, red flags, where to shop, and what to do after you buy</p>

    <p>A twin-lens reflex camera is a mechanical device built fifty to seventy years ago. There are no firmware updates, no warranty, and no two used examples are in the same condition. The difference between a great buy and an expensive paperweight comes down to knowing what to inspect and what to walk away from.</p>

    <p>This guide covers the <em>process</em> of buying a used TLR &mdash; how to evaluate one, where to find one, and how to verify it works after you bring it home. If you're still deciding which model to buy, read our <a href="/blog/tlr-buyers-guide.html">TLR buyer's guide</a> first, which covers model recommendations at every budget from $80 to $2,000+. Then come back here when you're ready to pull the trigger.</p>

    <h2>The Complete Inspection Checklist</h2>

    <p>Whether you're standing in a camera shop, meeting a seller at a swap meet, or deciding whether an online listing looks trustworthy, these are the eight things to check &mdash; in order of importance.</p>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">1</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Shutter</h3>
        <p>The shutter is the most important mechanical component. If the shutter doesn't work, the camera doesn't take pictures. Here's how to test it thoroughly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fire at every marked speed.</strong> Cock the shutter and fire it at each speed from the slowest (usually 1 second) to the fastest (1/300 or 1/500). You should hear a clear, audible difference between slow and fast speeds. At 1 second, you should hear the shutter open, a distinct pause, then close. At 1/500, you should hear a single sharp click.</li>
          <li><strong>Listen for hesitation.</strong> If the shutter sounds the same at 1 second and 1/10, the slow-speed escapement is gummed up. This is the most common shutter problem on TLRs &mdash; old lubricant thickens over decades and slows the mechanism. A CLA will fix it, but factor in $100&ndash;200. See our <a href="/guides/sticky-shutters.html">sticky shutters guide</a> for diagnosis tips and the exercise trick that sometimes frees a sluggish shutter.</li>
          <li><strong>Test bulb mode.</strong> Set the shutter to B. Open the back of the camera. Hold the shutter open and look through the lens from the back &mdash; you should see light coming through. Release the shutter and confirm it snaps closed cleanly. This verifies the shutter blades aren't stuck and that the B (bulb) mechanism works.</li>
          <li><strong>Fire each speed multiple times.</strong> A shutter that sticks intermittently is worse than one that's consistently slow, because you can't predict when it will fail. Fire each speed at least three times.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the self-timer</strong> (if the camera has one). Self-timers are the first thing to seize on old cameras. If it's jammed, leave it alone &mdash; forcing a stuck self-timer can damage the shutter. A non-working self-timer isn't a dealbreaker unless it's preventing the shutter from firing normally.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>The "hold it to your ear" trick</strong>
      <p>At faster speeds (1/125 and above), the difference between speeds is hard to hear at arm's length. Hold the camera close to your ear and fire the shutter. You'll hear the difference between 1/125 and 1/500 much more clearly. With practice, you can estimate whether speeds are roughly accurate by ear alone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">2</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Lens Inspection</h3>
        <p>The taking lens (bottom lens on a TLR) is what actually forms the image on your film. The viewing lens (top) only affects the viewfinder brightness. Focus your inspection on the taking lens, but check both.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Haze.</strong> Open the lens to its widest aperture and look through it toward a bright light source (a window or lamp). Rotate the lens slightly and look for a milky, cloudy coating across the glass. Light haze reduces contrast but doesn't destroy sharpness. Heavy haze makes the lens unusable for anything except soft-focus effects. Haze on the front or rear element can sometimes be cleaned. Haze between internal elements requires professional disassembly.</li>
          <li><strong>Fungus.</strong> Fungus looks like branching white or gray filaments, sometimes resembling frost or a spider web, on the glass surfaces. It usually starts at the edges and grows inward. Surface fungus on the front or rear element can be cleaned if caught early. Fungus between internal elements, or fungus that has etched into the glass coating, is permanent damage. Walk away from heavy internal fungus.</li>
          <li><strong>Separation.</strong> Multi-element lenses have groups of glass elements cemented together with balsam (a natural resin). Over decades, this cement can break down, causing the elements to separate. Separation looks like a rainbow sheen or Newton's rings (concentric colored circles) when you look through the lens at an angle. Separation is expensive to repair and often not worth fixing.</li>
          <li><strong>Cleaning marks.</strong> Faint scratches or swirl marks on the front element from decades of wiping. Minor cleaning marks have virtually zero impact on image quality &mdash; the lens is focused at infinity, not on its own surface. Don't let cosmetic cleaning marks scare you away from an otherwise good lens.</li>
          <li><strong>Coatings.</strong> Coated elements show a purple, amber, or blue reflection when viewed at an angle. Uncoated elements (found on older cameras) show a white reflection. Coated lenses have better contrast, especially in backlit situations. Missing or damaged coatings appear as patches with a different color reflection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To inspect: open the aperture fully, hold the lens toward a bright light, and look through from both ends. Then tilt the lens at various angles to catch internal reflections. A small penlight or phone flashlight is useful for illuminating the interior elements.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">3</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Focus Mechanism</h3>
        <p>TLRs focus by moving the entire lens board forward and back. The focus knob (usually on the left side) turns a helicoid mechanism that drives this movement.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Full-range test.</strong> Turn the focus knob from the closest focus distance to infinity and back. The movement should be smooth and even throughout the range, with no sudden stiff spots or dead zones.</li>
          <li><strong>Check for play.</strong> With the focus set to any position, gently push and pull the lens board. There should be no wobble or looseness. Play in the focusing mechanism means the lens board isn't being held firmly, which causes focus inaccuracy.</li>
          <li><strong>Helicoid smoothness.</strong> The focus should have a slight, even resistance &mdash; enough to hold its position but not so much that you have to force it. A very stiff helicoid needs re-lubrication. A focus that moves too freely (no resistance at all) may have been disassembled incorrectly or have worn threads.</li>
          <li><strong>Verify through the viewfinder.</strong> Open the waist-level finder and watch the ground glass image while turning the focus knob. The image should track smoothly from blurry to sharp. If it doesn't change, the viewing lens may be stuck or disconnected from the focus mechanism.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">4</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Film Advance</h3>
        <p>The film advance mechanism is the second most common failure point after the shutter. On most TLRs, the advance knob transports the film and cocks the shutter in a linked sequence.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Turn the advance knob (or crank).</strong> It should move with smooth, even resistance. Grinding, clicking, or sudden catches indicate worn or damaged gears. On cameras with auto-stop frame counters, the advance should stop after one full frame and lock until the shutter is fired.</li>
          <li><strong>Test the interlock.</strong> On cameras with coupled film advance and shutter cocking (like the <a href="/cameras/yashica-mat-124g.html">Yashica-Mat 124G</a>), firing the shutter should release the advance mechanism. Try the full cycle: advance (should lock) &rarr; fire shutter &rarr; advance again. This sequence should repeat reliably.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the frame counter.</strong> If the camera has one, verify it advances with each frame. A broken frame counter won't affect the camera's ability to take photos, but you'll need to track frames manually using the red window on the back (if the camera has one).</li>
          <li><strong>Open the back and watch.</strong> With the back open, advance the film and watch the take-up spool hub. It should rotate smoothly. Check that the film path guides and rollers are clean and free of corrosion.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">5</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Film Back and Door</h3>
        <p>The back of the camera must form a light-tight seal when closed. Any gap lets light in and fogs your film.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Light seal condition.</strong> Open the back and look at the foam or felt strips around the edges where the back meets the body. If the foam is crumbling into black dust, the seals need replacement. This is the single most common issue on old cameras &mdash; and the easiest to fix. Replacement light seal kits cost $5&ndash;15, and installation takes about 30 minutes. Do not let bad light seals deter you from an otherwise good camera.</li>
          <li><strong>Door latch tightness.</strong> Close the back and try to open it without pressing the release. The latch should hold firmly with no play. A loose latch can pop open during shooting, ruining the entire roll. This is harder to fix than light seals and may require a repair technician.</li>
          <li><strong>Back flatness.</strong> Lay the camera back on a flat surface (like a table). It should sit flat with no warping or bowing. A warped back holds the film at an incorrect distance from the lens, causing uneven focus across the frame.</li>
          <li><strong>Red window.</strong> Check the red window (the small window on the back used for reading frame numbers on the film backing paper). The red filter should be intact and the window should have a sliding cover. A missing filter isn't critical but can cause light fogging on very long exposures.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>Light seals are not a dealbreaker</strong>
      <p>Nearly every TLR over thirty years old needs new light seals. It's a fifteen-dollar, thirty-minute repair that anyone can do at home. See our <a href="/guides/light-seal-replacement.html">light seal replacement guide</a> for step-by-step instructions. If a seller drops the price because of bad seals, that's a win for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">6</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Bellows (Mamiya C-Series)</h3>
        <p>This step only applies to bellows-focusing TLRs, primarily the <a href="/cameras/mamiya-c330f.html">Mamiya C220 and C330 series</a>. Most other TLRs use a rigid helicoid focus and don't have bellows. For a detailed guide on bellows diagnosis and repair options, see our <a href="/guides/bellows-inspection.html">bellows inspection guide</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flashlight test.</strong> Take the camera into a dark room (or cover it with a dark cloth). Open the back and shine a bright flashlight or phone light through the bellows from the front. Look at the bellows from inside the camera body. Any pinholes of light shining through mean the bellows have deteriorated. Small pinholes can be patched temporarily with liquid electrical tape, but deteriorating bellows will continue to develop new holes.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the folds.</strong> Gently extend the bellows to their maximum (closest focus) and look at the folds and corners. The material should be supple, not brittle or cracked. The corners are where deterioration usually starts.</li>
          <li><strong>Replacement cost.</strong> If the bellows need replacing, budget $80&ndash;150 for a replacement bellows unit plus labor, or $30&ndash;50 for a DIY bellows kit if you're handy. Factor this into the purchase price.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">7</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Body Condition</h3>
        <p>Cosmetic condition matters less than mechanical condition, but some body damage is more than cosmetic.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dents near the lens board or film plane.</strong> Any dent or deformation near the lens mount area or the film plane can misalign the optical path, causing soft or unevenly-focused images. These dents affect function and are expensive to fix. Dents on the top plate, bottom plate, or sides are usually cosmetic only.</li>
          <li><strong>Leatherette.</strong> The faux-leather covering on most TLRs shrinks and peels over time. Missing or peeling leatherette is cosmetic &mdash; it doesn't affect function. Replacement leatherette kits are available for most models for $10&ndash;20, and the job is straightforward &mdash; see our <a href="/guides/leatherette-replacement.html">leatherette replacement guide</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Knobs and levers.</strong> Check that all knobs, levers, and switches are present and functional. Missing knobs can sometimes be replaced, but finding exact replacements for specific models can be difficult. A missing film advance knob is a bigger problem than a missing strap lug cover.</li>
          <li><strong>Tripod socket.</strong> Check the 3/8" or 1/4" tripod socket on the bottom. If the threads are stripped, the camera can't be mounted on a tripod. Not critical if you only shoot handheld, but limits your options for <a href="/guides/long-exposure.html">long exposures</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Strap lugs.</strong> Verify the strap lugs are solid and not bent or cracked. A camera dropped because of a failed strap lug is a bad day.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">8</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Viewfinder</h3>
        <p>The viewfinder doesn't affect the image on film, but a dim or damaged viewfinder makes the camera significantly harder to use.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mirror condition.</strong> Open the waist-level finder and look down at the ground glass. The image should be bright and clear. If it's dim or has dark spots, the mirror below the ground glass may be corroded or fogged. Mirror replacement is possible but adds cost.</li>
          <li><strong>Ground glass brightness.</strong> A good ground glass shows a bright, contrasty image. A degraded ground glass looks dim and flat. Some cameras have aftermarket bright screens available (Maxwell screens for Rolleiflex, for example) that dramatically improve viewfinder brightness.</li>
          <li><strong>Magnifier.</strong> Most TLR waist-level finders have a flip-up magnifier for precise focusing. Check that it flips up, locks in position, and flips back down. The magnifier optic should be clean and clear. A broken magnifier spring is a common minor issue.</li>
          <li><strong>Sports finder.</strong> Many TLRs have a pop-up sports finder (a wire frame) built into the waist-level finder hood. Check that it deploys and folds back correctly. Not essential for most shooting, but nice to have.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Red Flags</h2>

    <p>Some problems are fixable. Others should make you walk away &mdash; or at least demand a steep discount. Here's what to watch for.</p>

    <div class="red-flag">
      <strong>"Untested" or "As-Is"</strong>
      <p>In the used camera market, "untested" almost always means "I tested it and it doesn't work, but I don't want to say that." Assume an untested camera is non-functional and price accordingly. The only exception is estate sales where the seller genuinely doesn't know how to operate a film camera &mdash; but even then, proceed with caution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="red-flag">
      <strong>Deep Internal Fungus</strong>
      <p>Surface fungus on the front or rear element can sometimes be cleaned. Fungus between internal elements &mdash; visible as branching filaments deep inside the lens when you look through it &mdash; requires professional disassembly and may have already etched the glass coatings permanently. Unless the camera is priced as a parts unit, walk away.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="red-flag">
      <strong>Grinding Film Advance</strong>
      <p>A film advance that grinds, clicks, or catches indicates damaged or stripped gears. This is an expensive repair that may require parts that no longer exist. The difference between a stiff advance (fixable with cleaning) and a grinding advance (damaged gears) is the sound: stiff is quiet resistance, grinding is audible metal-on-metal noise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="red-flag">
      <strong>Jammed Shutter</strong>
      <p>If the shutter won't fire at all, the camera is a paperweight until it's repaired. A CLA might fix it, or the shutter mechanism might be damaged beyond economical repair. Unless the camera is priced as a non-working unit, don't buy a jammed shutter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="red-flag">
      <strong>Missing Knobs or Levers</strong>
      <p>Finding exact replacement parts for a specific TLR model can range from difficult to impossible. A missing film advance knob, focus knob, or shutter speed lever may render the camera unusable or require a machinist to fabricate a replacement. Factor in the cost and difficulty of sourcing parts before buying.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="red-flag">
      <strong>Heavy Dents Near the Lens Board or Film Plane</strong>
      <p>A dent on the top plate is cosmetic. A dent near where the lens attaches to the body, or near the film plane at the back, can misalign the optical path and cause permanently soft or unevenly-focused images. These are not fixable without specialized tools and expertise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="red-flag">
      <strong>"Just Needs a CLA"</strong>
      <p>This is seller shorthand for "it doesn't work properly, but I want you to pay close to working price." A camera that "just needs a CLA" might need a $100 routine service, or it might need $300 in parts and labor. Unless you can verify specifically what's wrong (sticky slow speeds, for example), treat "needs CLA" as "not working" and price accordingly. The phrase "just" is doing a lot of heavy lifting.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Where to Buy</h2>

    <p>Each marketplace has its own dynamics, advantages, and pitfalls. Here's how to navigate them.</p>

    <h3>eBay</h3>
    <p>The largest marketplace for used TLR cameras. Most transactions go well, but eBay requires the most buyer diligence.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Search tips.</strong> Search the specific model name (e.g., "Yashica-Mat 124G" rather than just "TLR camera"). Use the "Sold Items" filter under completed listings to see what cameras actually sold for &mdash; not what sellers are asking. This is your best tool for determining fair market value.</li>
      <li><strong>Read the description carefully.</strong> Look for specific claims: "shutter fires at all speeds," "lens is clean with no haze or fungus," "film advance is smooth." Vague descriptions ("nice vintage camera, looks great on a shelf") are a warning sign. If the listing doesn't mention shutter testing, the seller probably didn't test it.</li>
      <li><strong>Check the photos.</strong> Look for photos of the actual camera, not stock images. Sellers who photograph the lens elements, the film chamber, and the shutter speed dial are usually more knowledgeable and honest. Ask for additional photos if needed &mdash; any reasonable seller will comply.</li>
      <li><strong>Seller feedback.</strong> Look at the seller's feedback rating and read recent reviews. A seller with 99%+ positive feedback over hundreds of transactions is a safer bet than a seller with 10 transactions and no camera-specific feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask questions.</strong> eBay's "Ask Seller a Question" feature exists for a reason. Ask specific questions: "Does the shutter fire cleanly at 1 second?" "Is there any haze or fungus in the taking lens?" Good sellers respond promptly and specifically.</li>
      <li><strong>eBay Buyer Protection.</strong> eBay's money-back guarantee covers items that are "not as described." If a seller claims the shutter works and it doesn't, you can return it. Document the condition with photos when the camera arrives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>KEH Camera</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.keh.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KEH</a> is the largest used camera dealer in the US. They grade, test, and warranty every camera they sell. You'll pay more than eBay, but you get reliability and recourse.</p>

    <table class="guide-table" role="table" aria-label="KEH grading system reference">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Grade</th><th>Condition</th><th>What to Expect</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>LN (Like New)</td><td>Near-mint</td><td>Minimal signs of use. Rarely available for vintage TLRs.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>EX (Excellent)</td><td>Light wear</td><td>Minor cosmetic wear. Fully functional. Best balance of condition and price.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>BGN (Bargain)</td><td>Moderate wear</td><td>Visible cosmetic wear but fully functional. Best value &mdash; the cosmetic flaws don't affect image quality.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>UG (Ugly)</td><td>Heavy wear</td><td>Significant cosmetic damage but still functional. Lowest price for a working camera. Great for a user who doesn't care about looks.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>KEH's BGN grade is the sweet spot</strong>
      <p>KEH's "Bargain" grade cameras are fully tested and functional with a 180-day warranty. The cosmetic wear that drops a camera from EX to BGN &mdash; brassing, scuffed leatherette, light scratches on the body &mdash; has zero impact on image quality. You save 20&ndash;30% over EX grade for the same photographic performance.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Japan Auction Proxies</h3>
    <p>Japan is where many TLR cameras were manufactured (Yashica, Mamiya, Minolta) and where a huge number remain in circulation. Japanese sellers tend to grade conservatively and describe honestly. The challenge is buying through a proxy service.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://buyee.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buyee</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.fromjapan.co.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FromJapan</a></strong> are the two most popular proxy services. They bid on Japanese auction sites (Yahoo Auctions Japan, Mercari JP) on your behalf, receive the item, and ship it internationally.</li>
      <li><strong>Pricing.</strong> Japan auction prices are often 20&ndash;40% below comparable US eBay prices for the same condition. But you need to factor in the proxy service fee (typically 5&ndash;10% of the item price), domestic Japanese shipping, international shipping ($30&ndash;60 for a camera), and potential customs duties. Do the full math before bidding.</li>
      <li><strong>Condition grading.</strong> Japanese sellers use a letter grade system (S, A, AB, B, C, D). An "AB" from a Japanese seller is often equivalent to "Excellent" from a US seller. Read the Japanese listing carefully (proxy services provide translation) and look at the photos.</li>
      <li><strong>No returns.</strong> Returning an item to Japan is expensive and difficult. You're buying with limited recourse. This is offset by the generally higher honesty in condition descriptions, but it's a risk to understand upfront.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Local Camera Shops</h3>
    <p>If you have a camera shop that carries used film equipment, this is the ideal buying experience: you can inspect the camera in person, ask the staff questions, and often get a short warranty.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Test everything.</strong> Ask to handle the camera. Run through the inspection checklist above. Fire the shutter at every speed. Check the lens. Open the back. A good camera shop will encourage this.</li>
      <li><strong>Negotiate gently.</strong> Small shops have tight margins. Don't demand eBay pricing &mdash; you're paying for the ability to inspect in person, the staff's knowledge, and the warranty. That said, most shops will negotiate modestly, especially if a camera has been sitting in the case for a while.</li>
      <li><strong>Build a relationship.</strong> If you become a regular, staff will set aside interesting cameras for you, give you first look at new arrivals, and be more generous with returns and exchanges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Camera Shows and Swap Meets</h3>
    <p>Camera shows (also called camera fairs or photo flea markets) gather dozens of vendors in one place. They're excellent for finding deals and for handling cameras before buying.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What to bring.</strong> A small penlight or phone flashlight for inspecting lenses. A loupe or magnifying glass if you have one. A fully charged phone for looking up fair market prices on the spot (check eBay completed listings). Cash &mdash; many vendors prefer it and may offer a discount.</li>
      <li><strong>Arrive early.</strong> The best cameras go in the first hour. Serious buyers are there when the doors open.</li>
      <li><strong>Negotiation.</strong> Prices at shows are usually negotiable. A reasonable opening offer is 10&ndash;15% below the asking price. If the camera has an issue you can point to (sticky slow speeds, missing lens cap, crumbling seals), use that as a negotiation point. Don't lowball &mdash; the camera community is small and vendors remember.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask the vendor about the camera's history.</strong> Many show vendors are knowledgeable collectors who can tell you about the camera's quirks, common problems, and maintenance history. This information is worth something.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate Sales</h3>
    <p>Estate sales can be a source of remarkable finds at below-market prices, because the organizers are selling household contents, not running a camera business.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Where to find them.</strong> <a href="https://www.estatesales.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EstateSales.net</a> is the main listing site in the US. Search for "camera" in your area and check new listings regularly. Look for estates described as belonging to photographers or hobbyists.</li>
      <li><strong>Inspect carefully.</strong> Estate sale cameras are uninspected by default. The pricing is based on what the estate sale company thinks "an old camera" is worth, which may be wildly high or low. Run through the full inspection checklist.</li>
      <li><strong>Look for the whole kit.</strong> Estate sales often sell cameras with accessories &mdash; cases, filters, lens hoods, manuals, even unused film. If the original owner was a photographer, you might find a well-maintained camera with everything you need included in the price.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Online Communities</h3>
    <p>Buying from fellow photographers can be the best experience &mdash; sellers who know and love the equipment tend to describe it honestly and price it fairly.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photomarket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/photomarket</a></strong> &mdash; Reddit's camera buy/sell/trade community. Sellers post timestamped photos and condition descriptions. PayPal Goods &amp; Services is the standard payment method, which gives you buyer protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Fred Miranda Buy &amp; Sell</strong> &mdash; long-running photography forum with an active used gear marketplace. Membership has a small fee, which tends to filter out casual sellers and scammers.</li>
      <li><strong>Facebook groups.</strong> Groups like "TLR Camera Collective" and "Medium Format Buy/Sell/Trade" have active communities. Check the seller's group history and use PayPal Goods &amp; Services for buyer protection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding CLA</h2>

    <p>CLA stands for <strong>clean, lubricate, and adjust</strong>. It's the standard service for mechanical cameras &mdash; the equivalent of an oil change and tune-up for a car. A technician disassembles the shutter mechanism, cleans out old lubricant, applies fresh grease and oil, and adjusts the shutter speeds to their correct timings. For a deep dive into what the process involves and how to find a good technician, see our <a href="/guides/understanding-cla.html">complete CLA guide</a>.</p>

    <table class="guide-table" role="table" aria-label="CLA cost reference by camera type">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Camera</th><th>Typical CLA Cost</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Yashica (A, D, Mat 124G)</td><td>$80&ndash;150</td><td>Common cameras, many technicians service them</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Rolleicord (V, Vb)</td><td>$100&ndash;175</td><td>Well-documented service procedures</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Mamiya C-series</td><td>$100&ndash;200</td><td>Body + lens CLA often priced separately</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Minolta Autocord</td><td>$100&ndash;175</td><td>Fewer technicians available</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>When Is a CLA Worth It?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Always worth it</strong> if you're buying a premium camera (Rolleiflex 2.8F, 3.5F) that hasn't been serviced in decades. The camera is worth enough that the CLA is a small percentage of its value, and the improvement in reliability is significant.</li>
      <li><strong>Usually worth it</strong> if the shutter speeds are visibly off (slow speeds all sound the same) but the camera is otherwise in good condition. A CLA will restore correct shutter timing.</li>
      <li><strong>Do the math</strong> for mid-range cameras. If a <a href="/cameras/yashica-mat-124g.html">Yashica-Mat 124G</a> costs $200 and needs a $120 CLA, you're in for $320 &mdash; which is close to what a clean, already-serviced example would cost. Sometimes it's better to pay more upfront for a camera that's already been serviced.</li>
      <li><strong>Rarely worth it</strong> for budget cameras. If the camera costs $80 and the CLA costs $120, you're spending more on the service than on the camera. At that point, find a better example instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>Factor CLA into your buying price</strong>
      <p>When comparing cameras, think in terms of total cost: purchase price + any needed CLA + light seal replacement. A $150 camera that needs a $120 CLA and $10 in light seals costs $280 total. A $250 camera that's already been serviced with fresh seals is the better deal, even though the sticker price is higher.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Negotiation Tips</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Know the market value.</strong> Before you make an offer or decide whether a price is fair, check eBay completed listings (not current listings &mdash; <em>completed sales</em>) for the same model in similar condition. This is what cameras actually sell for, not what people wish they'd sell for.</li>
      <li><strong>Point to specific issues.</strong> "I noticed the slow speeds are off and the light seals need replacing &mdash; would you take $X?" is a reasonable negotiation. You're not lowballing; you're adjusting the price for documented repair costs. Sellers respect specific, informed observations.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't lowball.</strong> The film camera community is small. People talk. A reputation for making insulting offers will close doors for you. An offer of 80&ndash;90% of asking price is reasonable. An offer of 50% is insulting unless the camera has significant undisclosed problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Bundle when possible.</strong> If a seller has multiple items, buying a camera plus a case, or a camera plus a lens (for Mamiya systems), gives you leverage to ask for a package discount.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash is leverage.</strong> At camera shows and in-person sales, offering cash (especially if the seller was expecting to pay PayPal or credit card fees) can earn you a 5&ndash;10% discount.</li>
      <li><strong>Be willing to walk away.</strong> The single most powerful negotiation tool is genuine willingness to not buy. There will always be another camera. If the price isn't right, politely decline and move on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Do After Buying</h2>

    <p>You've bought a camera. Now you need to verify it actually works before committing important shots to it.</p>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">1</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Shoot a Test Roll</h3>
        <p>Load a roll of inexpensive 120 film. ISO 400 black-and-white (Ilford HP5+ or Kodak Tri-X) is ideal &mdash; it's forgiving of exposure errors and easy to develop. For loading instructions, see our <a href="/guides/loading-120-film.html">guide to loading 120 film</a>. Shoot all 12 frames methodically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frames 1&ndash;4:</strong> Test shutter speeds. Shoot the same subject at different speed/aperture combinations that should produce the same exposure (e.g., 1/500 at f/3.5, 1/250 at f/5.6, 1/125 at f/8, 1/60 at f/11). If the shutter speeds are accurate, all four frames should look equally exposed.</li>
          <li><strong>Frames 5&ndash;8:</strong> Test focus accuracy. Shoot a subject with fine detail (a brick wall, a bookshelf, a tree trunk) at different focus distances. Include subjects at close focus, middle distance, and infinity.</li>
          <li><strong>Frames 9&ndash;12:</strong> General shooting. Take the camera out and shoot normally. Include backlit subjects (to test for flare), high-contrast scenes, and both horizontal and vertical compositions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">2</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Develop and Inspect</h3>
        <p>Develop the roll (or have it developed at a lab) and examine the negatives carefully:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Light leaks.</strong> Look for orange or fogged streaks along the edges of the film. Consistent fogging on one edge suggests a light seal problem. Random bright patches could be a back latch issue or a pinhole in the body. If you see light leaks, replace the light seals and shoot another test roll.</li>
          <li><strong>Exposure consistency.</strong> The four speed-test frames should be roughly equally dense on the negative. If one frame is noticeably thinner (underexposed) or denser (overexposed), the corresponding shutter speed is off.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus accuracy.</strong> Examine the focus-test frames with a loupe. The plane of sharp focus should be where you put it. If focus is consistently off in one direction (front-focus or back-focus), the ground glass may be misaligned &mdash; a repair that a technician can correct.</li>
          <li><strong>Frame spacing.</strong> On the developed roll, the gaps between frames should be even. Uneven spacing suggests the film advance mechanism isn't transporting film consistently. Overlapping frames are a bigger problem than slightly uneven spacing.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">3</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Replace Light Seals if Needed</h3>
        <p>If your test roll shows light leaks (or if you already noticed crumbling foam during inspection), replace the light seals. This is the most common maintenance task for any TLR and requires no special tools &mdash; just replacement foam, a toothpick for removing old material, and isopropyl alcohol for cleaning the channels. See our <a href="/guides/light-seal-replacement.html">complete light seal replacement guide</a> for detailed instructions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>Use metergeist for your test roll</strong>
      <p><a href="/">metergeist</a> constrains its exposure recommendations to the exact aperture and shutter speed values your camera actually has. Select your TLR model in the app and meter each shot &mdash; it takes the guesswork out of exposure so you can focus on evaluating the camera's mechanical performance.</p>
