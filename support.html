    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>metergeist is a light meter and film roll tracker for film photographers. Here's how to get started:</p>

    <h3>1. Add a Camera</h3>
    <p>Tap the camera icon in the top right to add your first camera. Choose from 11 camera profiles (Yashica, Rolleiflex, Rolleicord, Mamiya, and more), then give it a nickname.</p>

    <h3>2. Load Film</h3>
    <p>Tap the film icon to load a roll. Choose from 19 film stocks. The app tracks your frame count automatically.</p>

    <h3>3. Meter Light</h3>
    <p>Point your iPhone at the scene. The app measures ambient light and recommends aperture and shutter speed settings for your film. Tap either value to lock it and let the other adjust.</p>

    <h3>4. Capture Reference Photos</h3>
    <p>Use the shutter button to capture a reference photo. Each shot is tied to your film roll with full exposure metadata, frame number, and optional text or voice notes. Compare with your developed film later.</p>

    <h3>5. Manage Your Rolls</h3>
    <p>View all your film rolls in the Gallery. Track each roll from shooting through development. Add notes at any time.</p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use focus peaking (Settings) to help nail manual focus</li>
      <li>The rule of thirds grid can be toggled in Settings</li>
      <li>Switch between cameras freely — film stays loaded on each body</li>
      <li>You can erase all data from Settings &gt; Advanced if you want a fresh start</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>Does metergeist need an internet connection?</h3>
    <p>No. The app works entirely offline. No account, no cloud, no network required.</p>

    <h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>
    <p>Everything is stored locally on your device. Nothing is uploaded or synced anywhere. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h3>Can I use metergeist with 35mm cameras?</h3>
    <p>The light metering works with any camera. The camera profiles currently focus on TLR and medium format models, but you can use the exposure readings with any film camera.</p>

    <h3>How accurate is the light meter?</h3>
    <p>The meter uses your iPhone's camera sensor to measure ambient light. It's calibrated for general-purpose metering and works well in most conditions. Like any reflected light meter, very bright or very dark scenes may benefit from exposure compensation.</p>
