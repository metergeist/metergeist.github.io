    <h1>How to Replace Light Seals on a TLR Camera</h1>
    <p class="updated">A practical guide to removing old foam, choosing materials, and sealing your camera against light leaks</p>

    <p>If you shoot a vintage TLR, replacing the light seals is the single most important maintenance task you can do. The good news: it&rsquo;s straightforward, inexpensive, and you absolutely can do it yourself. No special skills required &mdash; just patience and a toothpick.</p>

    <h2>Why Light Seals Matter</h2>
    <p>Light seals are thin strips of foam (or sometimes felt) that line the edges of your camera&rsquo;s back door. Their job is simple: prevent light from leaking into the film chamber through the gap where the back meets the body. When they work, you never think about them. When they fail, every roll of film tells you.</p>

    <h3>What Happens When They Fail</h3>
    <p>Degraded light seals let stray light creep onto your film. The symptoms are unmistakable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Orange or red streaks</strong> on color negatives, typically along one edge of the frame</li>
      <li><strong>Bright fogging</strong> on frame edges, especially on the side nearest the back door hinge or latch</li>
      <li><strong>Inconsistent exposure</strong> on frames that sat in the camera longest (the light leak accumulates over time)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why They Fail</h3>
    <p>The original foam in most vintage cameras was an open-cell polyurethane. After 20 to 40 years, this foam breaks down chemically. It doesn&rsquo;t just wear out &mdash; it decomposes into a sticky, tar-like residue that crumbles when touched. If you&rsquo;ve ever opened an old camera and found black goo where the foam should be, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
    <p>Almost every vintage TLR sold today needs new light seals. It&rsquo;s not a question of if &mdash; it&rsquo;s a question of whether the previous owner already replaced them.</p>

    <h2>How to Tell If You Need New Seals</h2>

    <h3>Visual Inspection</h3>
    <p>Open the camera back and look at the edges of the door and the grooves in the body where the door sits. You&rsquo;re looking for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Crumbling or sticky foam</strong> &mdash; press it gently with a toothpick. Healthy foam springs back. Degraded foam crumbles, sticks, or has already turned to goo.</li>
      <li><strong>Missing foam</strong> &mdash; bare metal channels where foam should be</li>
      <li><strong>Hardened, compressed foam</strong> &mdash; old foam that hasn&rsquo;t decomposed yet but has lost its cushion and no longer forms a light-tight seal</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Shooting Symptoms</h3>
    <p>If your negatives show bright streaks or fogging on one side &mdash; consistently, across multiple rolls &mdash; light seals are the most likely culprit. The streaks typically appear on the same side of every frame because the leak is always in the same physical location on the camera.</p>

    <h3>The Flashlight Test</h3>
    <p>For a definitive check: take the camera into a completely dark room. Close the back (with no film loaded). Shine a bright flashlight or phone torch slowly around every edge of the back door, the hinges, and the latch. Look into the camera from the front, through the taking lens opening. Any light you see getting through means you have a leak. Move the flashlight slowly &mdash; some leaks are tiny and easy to miss.</p>

    <h3>Where to Buy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.uscamera.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USCamera</a></strong> &mdash; pre-cut seal kits for specific camera models. Includes the right thicknesses and sizes, with instructions. Around $10&ndash;15.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://www.interslice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Goodman / Interslice</a></strong> &mdash; handmade pre-cut kits, highly regarded in the film community. Excellent quality and fit.</li>
      <li><strong>eBay</strong> &mdash; generic light seal foam sheets in various thicknesses. Cheaper ($3&ndash;5), but you measure and cut everything yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>Amazon</strong> &mdash; self-adhesive craft foam sheets. The budget option &mdash; works fine, but the adhesive may not be as durable long-term.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>Pre-cut kits vs. DIY</strong>
      <p>Pre-cut kits from USCamera or Jon Goodman cost $10&ndash;15 and save significant time. Generic foam sheets cost $3&ndash;5 but you&rsquo;ll spend an hour measuring and cutting. For your first camera, a pre-cut kit is absolutely worth it. Once you&rsquo;ve done a few cameras and understand the seal locations, cutting your own from bulk foam becomes practical.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Removing Old Seals</h2>
    <p>This is the tedious part. Removing decomposed foam is a messy, patience-testing job. Budget 30 minutes to an hour for removal and cleaning, depending on how badly the old seals have deteriorated.</p>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">1</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Open the Camera Back</h3>
        <p>Open the back door fully. If your camera&rsquo;s back is removable, take it off completely &mdash; it&rsquo;s much easier to work with. Remove any film spool or insert.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">2</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Identify All Seal Locations</h3>
        <p>Look for foam in these typical locations: top edge of the back door, bottom edge, both sides, and the hinge side. Some cameras also have foam around the film pressure plate or inside the latch mechanism. Take a photo before you start so you remember where everything goes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">3</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Pick Out the Old Foam</h3>
        <p>Use a wooden toothpick or bamboo skewer to scrape and pull out the old foam. Work in sections. For stubborn chunks in deep channels, needle-nose pliers can help.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Never use metal tools on or near the film plane area. A scratch on the film rails or pressure plate will show as a line on every single frame you shoot.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">4</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Clean All Residue</h3>
        <p>Dip cotton swabs in isopropyl alcohol (90%+) and scrub out the grooves and channels. The alcohol dissolves the old adhesive. You may need to go through quite a few cotton swabs &mdash; the black residue is persistent. Keep going until the swab comes away clean.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">5</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Let Everything Dry</h3>
        <p>Wait at least 15&ndash;20 minutes for the alcohol to evaporate completely. New foam adhesive won&rsquo;t stick properly to damp surfaces.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">6</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Be Patient</h3>
        <p>Old decomposed foam can be incredibly sticky and resistant to removal. If you&rsquo;re struggling, apply more alcohol, let it soak for a minute, then try again. Don&rsquo;t rush &mdash; a clean surface is essential for the new seals to adhere properly and last.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Installing New Seals</h2>
    <p>With clean, dry channels, installation goes quickly. This is the satisfying part.</p>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">1</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Cut Foam Strips to Size</h3>
        <p>If using a pre-cut kit, skip this step. Otherwise, measure the width and length of each channel and cut strips of the appropriate thickness foam to match. Cut slightly long rather than short &mdash; you can always trim in place.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">2</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Test-Fit Each Piece</h3>
        <p>Before peeling the adhesive backing, lay each strip into its channel to check the fit. It should sit snugly without bunching or leaving gaps. If a piece is too wide, trim it. If the foam is too thick, the back door won&rsquo;t close properly.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">3</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Peel and Press</h3>
        <p>Peel the adhesive backing from one end and press the strip into the channel, working from one end to the other. Go slowly and keep the strip straight. It&rsquo;s much harder to reposition once the adhesive makes contact.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">4</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Seat the Foam Firmly</h3>
        <p>Use a toothpick to press the foam firmly into channels and grooves, especially at corners and ends. Make sure the foam is seated all the way down &mdash; it should be flush with or slightly proud of the channel edges.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">5</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Check the Door Closure</h3>
        <p>Close the back door and make sure it latches properly. There should be some resistance from the foam compressing &mdash; that&rsquo;s good, it means you have a tight seal. If the door is very difficult to close or won&rsquo;t latch, the foam may be too thick. Try the next thinner size.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">6</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Allow Settling Time</h3>
        <p>Fresh foam will compress slightly over the first few days of normal use. If the door feels a little stiff at first, don&rsquo;t worry &mdash; it will loosen up. Close the back and leave it overnight before loading film.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Model-Specific Notes</h2>
    <p>Different TLR families have their own quirks. Here are tips for the most popular models:</p>

    <h3>Yashica (Mat-124G, A, D, and others)</h3>
    <p>The most common TLRs for beginners, and thankfully straightforward to reseal. Standard foam around the back door in a rectangular channel. <strong>1.5mm foam</strong> works for most Yashica models. One often-missed detail: many Yashica TLRs have a small felt light trap around the <strong>red frame counter window</strong> on the back. If this felt is missing or degraded, replace it too &mdash; it&rsquo;s a common source of mysterious fogging.</p>

    <h3>Rolleiflex and Rolleicord</h3>
    <p>German engineering means tighter tolerances throughout. Use <strong>1mm foam</strong> &mdash; thicker foam will prevent the back door from latching on many Rolleiflex models. The back door fit is precise by design, so even slightly oversized foam will cause problems. Take extra care with measurements. On Rolleicords, also check the edges of the film loading chamber &mdash; some models have additional thin felt strips here.</p>

    <h3>Mamiya C-Series (C220, C330, and variants)</h3>
    <p>Back door seals follow the standard approach, but Mamiya C-series cameras introduce an additional concern: the <strong>bellows</strong>. The bellows are a separate light seal system that can develop pinholes over time. After replacing the back door seals, inspect the bellows by shining a light inside the camera with the back closed and looking for pinholes from the outside in a dark room. Some C-series models also have additional felt around the <strong>lens board</strong> where the interchangeable lens assembly meets the body.</p>

    <h3>Minolta Autocord</h3>
    <p>Similar to Yashica in approach. <strong>1.5mm foam</strong> for the back door channels. If your Autocord model has a sliding <strong>dark slide slot</strong>, check that the felt or foam around the slot opening is intact &mdash; light can leak through here as well. The Autocord&rsquo;s back door is well-designed and straightforward to reseal.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>Don&rsquo;t skip the red window seal</strong>
      <p>On cameras with red frame counter windows on the back, there&rsquo;s often a small foam or felt piece that seals around the window. This is the most frequently overlooked seal location. The red window filter blocks most light, but not all of it &mdash; especially with sensitive films like ISO 400 and above. If you&rsquo;re seeing fogging in the center of your frames (not the edges), the red window seal is the first thing to check.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Testing After Installation</h2>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t just trust your work &mdash; verify it. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">1</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Load a Test Roll</h3>
        <p>Use inexpensive film for the test &mdash; a roll of Fomapan 100 or whatever you have on hand. This isn&rsquo;t the roll for your masterpiece.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">2</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Shoot in Bright Sunlight</h3>
        <p>Light leaks are worst in bright conditions. Shoot outdoors on a sunny day. This is the stress test.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">3</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Deliberately Expose the Camera to Sun</h3>
        <p>Between frames, leave the camera sitting in direct sunlight for 30 seconds to a minute before advancing and shooting the next frame. This exaggerates any remaining leaks and makes them easier to spot on the developed negatives.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">4</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>Develop and Inspect</h3>
        <p>Develop the roll and examine the negatives carefully. Look for any fogging, streaks, or bright areas along the edges. If the frames are clean, your seals are good.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">5</span>
      <div class="step-content">
        <h3>If Leaks Persist</h3>
        <p>Re-examine every seal location. Common culprits: a corner where two foam strips meet with a gap, the red window seal, or a seal that isn&rsquo;t seated fully in its channel. Re-do the flashlight test to pinpoint the leak. Sometimes it takes two attempts to get every spot.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Work in good light.</strong> You need to see inside those narrow channels clearly. A desk lamp or headlamp helps enormously.</li>
      <li><strong>Take photos before you start.</strong> Snap pictures of the original seal layout from every angle. When you&rsquo;re halfway through installation and can&rsquo;t remember which channel gets 1mm vs 1.5mm foam, you&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t reuse old foam.</strong> Even if some sections look okay, replace everything. Foam that looks fine today may crumble next month. You&rsquo;re already doing the work &mdash; do it all at once.</li>
      <li><strong>Replace seals on newly purchased cameras.</strong> When <a href="/guides/buying-a-tlr.html">buying a used TLR</a>, assume it needs new light seals unless the seller explicitly states they were recently replaced. Budget $10&ndash;15 and 90 minutes into your purchase.</li>
      <li><strong>New seals last 10&ndash;15 years.</strong> Modern closed-cell foam degrades much more slowly than the original open-cell foam used in the 1960s&ndash;80s. You won&rsquo;t need to do this again anytime soon.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>You can do this</strong>
      <p>Replacing light seals is one of the least intimidating camera repairs you can do. There&rsquo;s no disassembly, no tiny screws, no risk of damaging the shutter mechanism. You&rsquo;re literally just swapping foam strips. If you can apply a screen protector to your phone, you can replace light seals on a camera. The first one takes about 90 minutes. After that, you&rsquo;ll knock them out in 30.</p>
